        <p>
        <small>Hypertext Markup Language</small> (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by <sub>technologies</sub> such as <b><i>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</i></b> and scripting <sup>languages</sup> such as <b>JavaScript</b>.

        <u>Web browsers receive HTML</u> documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. <s>HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.</s>

        <h2>istoria limbajului html</h2>

        <p>
        In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system.[3] Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes[4] from 1990 he listed[5] "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used" and put an encyclopedia first.

        The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags", first mentioned on the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991.[6][7] It describes 18 elements comprising the initial, relatively simple design of HTML. Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced by SGMLguid, an in-house Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)-based documentation format at CERN. Eleven of these elements still exist in HTML 4.[8]
